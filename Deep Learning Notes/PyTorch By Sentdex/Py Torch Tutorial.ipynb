    "Above, we're just loading in the dataset, shuffling it, and applying any transforms/pre-processing to a tensor object\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to handle for how we're going to iterate over that dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training and Testing data split\n",
    "To train any machine learning model, we want to first off have training and validation datasets. This is so we can use data that the machine has never seen before to \"test\" the machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shuffling\n",
    "Then, within our training dataset, we generally want to randomly shuffle the input data as much as possible to hopefully not have any patterns in the data that might throw the machine off.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you fed the machine a bunch of images of zeros, the machine would learn to classify everything as zero. Then you'd start feeding it ones, and the machine would figure out pretty quick to classify everything as ones...and so on. Whenever you stop, the machine would probably just classify everything as the last thing you trained on. If you shuffle the data, your machine is much more likely to figure out what's what.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scaling and normalization\n",
    "Another consideration at some point in the pipeline is usually scaling/normalization of the dataset. In general, we want all input data to be between zero and one. Often many datasets will contain data in ranges that are not within this range, and we generally will want to come up with a way to scale the data to be within this range.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an image is comprised of pixel values, most often in the range of 0 to 255. To scale image data, you usually just divide by 255. That's it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Batches\n",
    "Once you've done all this, you then want to pass your training dataset to your neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not so fast!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major reasons why you can't just go and pass your entire dataset at once to your neural network:\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks shine and outperform other machine learning techniques because of how well they work on big datasets. Gigabytes. Terabytes. Petabytes! \n",
    "\n",
    "When we're just learning, we tend to play with datasets smaller than a gigabyte, and we can often just toss the entire thing into the VRAM of our GPU or even more likely into RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, in practice, you would likely not get away with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim with neural networks is to have the network generalize with the data. We want the neural network to actually learn general principles. That said, neural networks often have millions, or tens of millions, of parameters that they can tweak to do this. This means neural networks can also just memorize things. While we hope neural networks will generalize, they often learn to just memorize the input data. Our job as the scientist is to make it as hard as possible for the neural network to just memorize.\n",
    "This is another reason why we often track \"in sample\" validation acccuracy and \"out of sample\" validation accuracy. If these two numbers are similar, this is good. As they start to diverge (in sample usually goes up considerably while out of sample stays the same or drops), this usually means your neural network is starting to just memorize things.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way we can help the neural network to not memorize is, at any given time, we feed only some specific batch size of data. This is often something between 8 and 64.\n",
    "\n",
    "This batching helps because, with each batch, the neural network does a back propagation for new, updated weights with hopes of decreasing that loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "With one giant passing of your data, this would include neuron changes that had nothing to do with general principles and were just brute forcing the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By passing many batches, each with their own gradient calcs, loss, and backprop, this means each time the neural network optimizes things, it will sort of \"keep\" the changes that were actually useful, and erode the ones that were just basically memorizing the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a large enough neural network, however, even with batches, your network can still just simply memorize.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also why we often try to make the smallest neural network as possible, so long as it still appears to be learning. In general, this will be a more successful model long term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we have our data, but what is it really? How do we work with it? We can iterate over our data like so:"

    "Is the data scaled?\n",
    "Is the data balanced?\n",
    "Looks like we have a couple more questions to answer. First off is it scaled? Remember earlier I warned that the neural network likes data to be scaled between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Raw imagery data is usually RGB, where each pixel is a tuple of values of 0-255, which is a problem. 0 to 255 is not scaled. How about our dataset here? Is it 0-255? or is it scaled already for us? Let's check out some lines:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data[0][0][0][0] =\n",
    "tensor([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.,\n",
    "        0., 0., 0., 0.])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm, it's empty. Makes sense, the first few rows are blank probably in a lot of images. The 2 up above certainly is.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data[0][0][0][3] =\n",
    "tensor([0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000,\n",
    "        0.0000, 0.0118, 0.4157, 0.9059, 0.9961, 0.9216, 0.5647, 0.1882, 0.0000,\n",
    "        0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000,\n",
    "        0.0000])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Ah okay, there we go, we can clearly see that... yep this image data is actually already scaled for us.... in the real world, it wont be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like I said: Cheating! Hah. Alright. One more question: Is the data balanced?\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is data balancing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall before how I explained that if we don't shuffle our data, the machine will learn things like what the last few hundred classes were in a row, and probably just predict that from there on out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, with data balancing, a similar thing could occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a dataset of cats and dogs. 7200 images are dogs, and 1800 are cats. This is quite the imbalance. The classifier is highly likely to find out that it can very quickly and easily get to a 72% accuracy by simple always predicting dog. It is highly unlikely that the model will recover from something like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other times, the imbalance isn't quite as severe, but still enough to make the model almost always predict a certain way except in the most obvious-to-it-of cases. Anyway, it's best if we can balance the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "By \"balance,\" I mean make sure there are the same number of examples for each classifications in training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, this simply isn't possible. There are ways for us to handle for this with special class weighting for the optimizer to take note of, but, even this doesn't always work. Personally, I've never had success with this in any real world application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, how might we confirm the balance of data? Well, we just need to iterate over everything and make a count. Pretty simple:"

Fully connected refers to the point that every neuron in this layer is going to be fully connected to attaching neurons. Nothing fancy going on here! Recall, each \"connection\" comes with weights and possibly biases, so each connection is a \"parameter\" for the neural network to play with.\n",

Instead, what we're missing is an activation function for the layers.\n",

    "Our loss_function is what calculates \"how far off\" our classifications are from reality. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of a machine learning by tweaking lots of little parameters to slowly get closer and closer to fitting, it definitely matters how wrong things are.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we use loss, which is a measurement of how far off the neural network is from the targeted output. There are a few types of loss calculations. A popular one is mean squared error, but we're trying to use these scalar-valued classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you're going to have two types of classes. One will just be a scalar value, the other is what's called a one_hot array/vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, a zero might be classified as:\n",
    "```python \n",
    "0 or [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ,0 ,0 ,0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The latter is a one_hot array where quite literally one element only is a 1 and the rest are zero. The index that is hot is the classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "A one_hot vector for a a 3 would be:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 ,0 ,0 ,0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "I tend to use one_hot, but this data is specifying a scalar class, so 0, or 1, or 2...and so on.\n",

    "Depending on what your targets look like, you will need a specific loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "For one_hot vectors, I tend to use mean squared error.\n",
    "For these scalar classifications, I use cross entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have our optimizer. This is the thing that adjusts our model's adjustable parameters like the weights, to slowly, over time, fit our data. I am going to have us using Adam, which is Adaptive Momentum. This is the standard go-to optimizer usually. There's a new one called rectified adam that is gaining steam. I haven't had the chance yet to make use of that in any project, and I do not think it's available as just an importable function in Pytorch yet, but keep your eyes peeled for it! For now, Adam will do just fine I'm sure. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other thing here is lr, which is the learning rate. A good number to start with here is 0.001 or 1e-3. The learning rate dictates the magnitude of changes that the optimizer can make at a time. Thus, the larger the LR, the quicker the model can learn, but also you might find that the steps you allow the optimizer to make are actually too big and the optimizer gets stuck bouncing around rather than improving. Too small, and the model can take much longer to learn as well as also possibly getting stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the learning rate as the \"size of steps\" that the optimizer can take as it searches for the bottom of a mountain, where the path to the bottom isn't necessarily a simple straight path down.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simpler tasks, a learning rate of 0.001 usually is more than fine. For more complex tasks, you will see a learning rate with what's called a decay. Basically you start the learning rate at something like 0.001, or 0.01...etc, and then over time, that learning rate gets smaller and smaller. The idea being you can initially train fast, and slowly take smaller steps, hopefully getthing the best of both worlds:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can iterate over our data. In general, you will make more than just 1 pass through your entire training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each full pass through your dataset is referred to as an epoch. In general, you will probably have somewhere between 3 and 10 epochs, but there's no hard rule here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Too few epochs, and your model wont learn everything it could have.\n",
    "Too many epochs and your model will over fit to your in-sample data (basically memorize the in-sample data, and perform poorly on out of sample data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go with 3 epochs for now. So we will loop over epochs, and each epoch will loop over our data. Something like:"

    "Alright! So now we have our training data in the form of inputs and outputs.\n",

    "Next, we'll make a Net class again, this time having the layers be convolutional.\n",
    "\n",
    "The layers have 1 more parameter after the input and output size, which is the kernel window size. This is the size of the \"window\" that you take of pixels. A 5 means we're doing a sliding 5x5 window for colvolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same rules apply, where you see the first layer takes in 1 image, outputs 32 convolutions, then the next is going to take in 32 convolutions/features, and output 64 more...and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now comes a new concept. Convolutional features are just that, they're convolutions, maybe max-pooled convolutions, but they aren't flat. We need to flatten them, like we need to flatten an image before passing it through a regular layer.\n",

    "Then we apply maxpool of size(2,2) which reduces the size by half across both dimensions of the image, hence new output size O = O/2\n",
    "\n",
    "At the last conv2d later, the input size to the linear layer is the image volume flattened out, hence it would be last O*O*last channel width\n",

Something like 5-10% accuracy difference is pretty common, but as this delta grows, it usually signals to us that our model is beginning to \"overfit\" (the neural network is just memorizing the data and changing weights to work only for the training data, rather than generally understanding the data).\n",

So now we know, at least with our current model/settings, that somewhere between 4 and 5 epochs is all we want to train for. We can see how bad things already are getting by 8-10 epochs. Validation accuracy doesn't seem to suffer much, interestingly enough, but we'd still probably want to stop far before this.\n",

Also, you can see just how well neural networks can generalize initially, but later overfit and just memorize the data later on. You can see that we're getting 100% accuracy on some of those batches, and, over time, that deviation from 100% accuracy is shrinking. If we keep training for more and more epochs, this model will eventually most likely reach a perfect 100% accuracy on in-sample data."
